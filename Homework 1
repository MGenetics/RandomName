1) The two functions of an Operating System is to manage the computer's resources and providing abstractions to user programs
2) Multiprogramming depends on devices to rotate between processes while timesharing depends on time to rotate to other processes
3) The family-of-computers idea was adopted by other manufacturers which are still being used to this day
4) Kernal mode is a form of supervisor mode where it has access to everything and can execute anything whereas user mode is only a small portion of the machine that is given to the user. Having 2 distinct modes can be beneficial because programs that ask for things from the user (like passwords) are not part of the kernel. The user can pass important data to the kernel so that it can protect it/find meaning for it. In a way, the user communicates things to  the kernel that the kernel cannot do (to some degree)
5) Multiprogramming becomes useless since the CPU is using all of its resources. Multiprogramming's job is to give the CPU things to do, but if the CPU is fully loaded, that cannot happen
6) Real time design goal, fairness system design
7) Change the memory map
8) It would only take 20msec to execute the programs
9) A trap instruction is an instruction used to switch from user mode to kernel mode. By switching to kernel mode, system calls/services can be executed
10) With the decoupling design, the system can decouple policy and mechanisms to make the kernel smaller and the system can decouple address space to better manage system memory
